Initially planned to have level save/load. This was scrapped as I decided to make the game only have one level.
Instead to meet the save/load requirement I implemented the high score system as an additional class.
This also meets the requirements regarding input validation.

Added unplanned alert system in order to deliver information to the player.

Due to implementation of AIInput input handler had to add additional AINode class.
